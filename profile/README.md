## Welcome to the 3D City Database!

The 3D City Database is a free and open-source solution for managing, analyzing, and utilizing virtual 3D city models
on top of a spatial database system. Its database schema implements the [OGC CityGML 3.0](https://www.ogc.org/standard/citygml/)
standard, and it includes a suite of software tools for importing, exporting, visualizing, and integrating your 3D city models into
automated workflows and processes.
